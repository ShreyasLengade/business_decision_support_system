# ImpactAnalysis-COVID19-GlobalTravel: A Data-Driven DSS on Pandemic's Effect on the Air Travel Industry
This project utilizes the OpenSky Network dataset to analyze the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the global travel industry. By comparing air traffic data from 2019, 2020, and 2021, our Data-Driven Decision Support System (DSS) aims to uncover the pandemicâ€™s effects on airlines, aircraft usage, and regional flight dynamics, enhancing our understanding of how travel patterns have adapted in response to the crisis.

### Flight-route Dashboard
<details>
  <summary><strong>Description</strong></summary>
The "Flight-route" analysis uses 2020 OpenSky Network data, integrated with ICAO-IATA information, to map flight routes during the COVID-19 period. By utilizing origin and destination coordinates, we track flights from each starting point to various destinations, measuring flight counts and distances. Additionally, a month-wise filter on our dashboard highlights the decline in flight activities during peak COVID-19 months and regional lockdowns.
